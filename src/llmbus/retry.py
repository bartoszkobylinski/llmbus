"""Retry/backoff policy, error classification, and the worker's run policy
(ARCHITECTURE.md §6).

The worker retries a model call on transient failures — 429, 5xx, timeouts,
connection drops — with exponential backoff and full jitter, giving up after a
bounded number of attempts. Everything in this module is **pure**: no SDK import,
no clock, no sleep. The policy types carry validated numbers, `is_retryable`
classifies an exception, and `backoff_delay` computes one wait from an injected
random draw. `processing.py`'s async loop supplies the real sleep and the real
exceptions, so this reliability-critical logic sits in the mutation gate instead
of integration-only code.

`is_retryable` **duck-types** the exception rather than importing the OpenAI /
Anthropic SDKs (which the adapters deliberately never import either, §7): a
transient HTTP failure exposes a `status_code` (both SDKs' `APIStatusError`
carries one), a slow call raises a `TimeoutError` (`asyncio.TimeoutError` is an
alias of it since 3.11), and a dropped connection surfaces as an
`APIConnectionError` / `APITimeoutError` — matched by class name so no SDK type
is needed here.

    delays is a true ceiling, not an average.

    This exists because a producer polling for a result must size its wait
